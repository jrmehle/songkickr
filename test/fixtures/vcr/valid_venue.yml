        was transformed into a rock venue and re-branded as The Sundown Centre. With
        limited success the venue closed it''s doors in 1974 and was not re-opened
        as a music venue again until 1983, when it became The Brixton Academy.\n\nFeaturing
        a beautiful Art Deco interior, the venue is now known as the 02 Academy Brixton,
        and hosts a diverse range of club nights and live performances, as well as
